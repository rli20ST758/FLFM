# LFLM
Latent Factor Model for Multivariate Functional Data

This project provides supplementary materials for the paper, Latent Factor Model for Multivariate Functional Data.
- The proposed method is implemented in the function FLFM() in the folder "R code";
- An exmple to run FLFM() is shown in the file demo.R;
- The RMD file provides examples of how to use the function FLFM(). Moreover, comparisons with MFPCA proposed in Happ and Greven (2018) are evaluated. It would help understand the proposed method.
